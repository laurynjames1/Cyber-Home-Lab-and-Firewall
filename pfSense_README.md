# pfSense Firewall Configuration Lab

## Overview

This project is part of the **Cyber Home Lab** repository. It walks through the step-by-step process of installing and configuring a **pfSense open-source firewall appliance** inside your virtual lab environment. This lab teaches you how to deploy a firewall, manage network traffic rules, and enforce security policies between your virtual machines and the internet.

## What is pfSense?

A **firewall** is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies.  
**pfSense** is one of the most widely used, free, and open-source firewall solutions in the industry.

## Lab Features

- Download and install pfSense in VirtualBox
- Connect pfSense to your existing virtual lab network via Bridged Adapter
- Configure network interfaces (WAN, optional LAN)
- Access the pfSense WebGUI
- Set static IP, DNS, and default gateway settings
- Create and enforce a custom firewall rule to block access to a specific domain
- Test the rule implementation from your Windows 10 virtual machine

---

## Prerequisites

- **VirtualBox** installed and configured (see [Cyber Home Lab Guide](./README.md))
- Existing virtual machines (Windows 10, Kali Linux, Metasploitable)
- ISO image for pfSense downloaded from:  
  [https://www.pfsense.org/download/](https://www.pfsense.org/download/)

## Lab Setup Process

1. Download pfSense ISO and 7-Zip utility for file extraction
2. Import pfSense into VirtualBox as a new virtual machine
3. Configure virtual hardware and network adapters
4. Install pfSense using Auto (UFS) BIOS partitioning
5. Remove ISO attachment post-installation to prevent boot loops
6. Finalize installation and skip VLAN configuration for simplicity
7. Set WAN interface and IP address settings via WebGUI
8. Create a firewall alias for `defendtheweb.net`
9. Add a firewall rule to block outbound traffic to that IP
10. Update your physical hostâ€™s network settings to route through the pfSense firewall
11. Test the rule by attempting to visit the blocked domain from your Windows 10 VM

## Key Commands

From Windows 10 VM:
```bash
nslookup defendtheweb.net
ping [pfSense IP]
